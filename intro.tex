The contributions of this paper include:

\begin{itemize}
\item A novel, language-independent, mutation-based (and test-based) approach to code similarity, where fragments of code that behave identically with respect to all possible inputs can still vary in their similarity, based on their dependencies on other code.
\item An examination of the tension between an implementation that makes use of external code to achieve better modularity and maintainability and an implementation that is not vulnerable to faults in other parts of a software system.
\item Experimental results comparing the notion of similarity used here with other similarity measures, e.g., in code clone detection tools, over large, real-world code bases.
\end{itemize}
